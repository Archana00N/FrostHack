# FrostHack
Submission Official Hack Juveniles Team Repo, for Frosthack, May 2021.

@everyone make sure you have a readme file in your github repository.
It should contain the following things:
1. instructions on how to run your code
2. list all the dependencies of your project
3. Give credit to any other open-source project or code that you use (Using someone else's code without giving them due credit will be considered as plagiarism.)


## About the Code:
###(And how to run)
It requires a database on phpmyAdmin on the localhost to access the database. Without it, the 'Oxygen form' will not work.

The way to create it in the Localhost of phpmyAdmin is: create new database, choose 5 columns. Name them:
State, City, Company_name, Person_name, Contact_number (type: bigint) with sufficient size(min 50 each).
Then, import the given csv file. Then you can open the main program (index.html) in your browser.

The CSS and JS file, along with the php files are present in the repo.
