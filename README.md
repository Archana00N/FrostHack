Submission Official Hack Juveniles Team Repo, for Frosthack, May 2021.

## About the Code:
**Highlights:** a very simple db filterer, a carousel, a puzzle.

**Usage instructions:**

It requires a database on phpmyAdmin on the localhost (XAMPP) to access the database. Without it, the 'Oxygen form' will not work.

The way to create it in the Localhost of phpmyAdmin is: create new database, choose 5 columns. Name them:
<br />State, City, Company_name, Person_name, Contact_number (type: bigint) with sufficient size(min 50 each).
<br />Then, import the given csv file. Then you can open the main program (index.html) in your browser.

The CSS and JS file, along with the php files are present in the repo.  Have used mysqli as well.
